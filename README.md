Ouranos is a Flask web application enabling predictive analytics of room occupancy on the University College Dublin Belfield campus.

  - Using ground truth data collected on campus
  - Development and cross-validation of various predicitive models
  - Implementation of result in a web application
  - Deployment onto Ubuntu virtual machine

You can also:
  - Add new data

> Develop a software system that will reflect whether a room is occupied or not
and estimate room occupancy based on wifi log data.
>Teams have freedom to decide on the scope. 

> The application developed also incorporates Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and audio data.
> This improves the predictive ability of our models answering the binary question: "Is the room occupied?"
