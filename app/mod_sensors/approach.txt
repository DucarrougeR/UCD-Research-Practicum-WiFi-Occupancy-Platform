INNOVATION
-----------------------------------
I. Identify "problem rooms"
    Go into all the rooms and find the ones in which you tend to connect to the AP while not inside
    Also look into the data to find rooms with big discrepencies suggesting the same phenomenon

II. Design an RSSI check
        Approach 1: machine learning
            Estimate a continuous count using support vector regression or similar
        Approach 2: simple check
            Check if the RSSI at the receiver node has deviated beyond a certain level from the baseline reading

III. Design an audio check
        Option 1: machine learning
            Estimate a continuous count using some machine learning method
        Option 2: simple check
            Check if audio levels deviate significantly from baseline readings
        Option 3: complex audio analysis (speaker recognition, etc.)
            Follow the literature and use audio-processing techniques to identify individual speakers in the 
            room to yield a continuous count (probably way too difficult for our purposes) 

IV. Deploy checks
    For "problem rooms", add a new table to the database with two rows that indicate whether either 
    check has triggered
    If the room is estimated to be occupied but neither check has triggered and ground truth is at 0, 
    we conclude that it is actually empty and change the record in the database

V. Investigate the "nuclear" option: computer-vision approach
    Although there are cost and privacy issues involved, if we have time we should investigate 
    determining whether someone is in the room using facial recognition and a camera. This can be done 
    quite easily using OpenCV, e.g.: http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/06/01/home-surveillance-and-motion-detection-with-the-raspberry-pi-python-and-opencv/


Needs:
rssi_baseline column in rooms 
audio_baseline column in rooms 

Take baseline readings for the 3 rooms
